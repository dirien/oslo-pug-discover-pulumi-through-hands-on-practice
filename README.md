# Discover Pulumi Through Hands-On Practice

## Welcome, Pulumi Friends! ðŸ‘‹

The goal of this workshop to get started with Pulumi to deploy and manage infrastructure in the cloud.
Although Pulumi works with any cloud provider such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, for the purposes of this workshop 
we will be sticking with [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) where we will learn how to deploy clustors and add
managed services to them, all via the Pulumi CLI. 

The workshop is split in small chapters to get you started quickly from installing the CLI all the way to deploying 
and managing nginx services on DigitalOcean.

### Repository

You can find the repository for this
workshop [here](https://github.com/dirien/cfgmgmtcamp-2025-discover-pulumi-through-hands-on-practice.git). Please feel
free to look for the examples in the different chapters if you get stuck.
